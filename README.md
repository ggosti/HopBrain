# HopBrain
Full brain mass model simulation using Hopfield Recurrent Neural Networks with Schaefer 2018 1000 Parcels

## Run simulations 

To run simulations run
'''
python turboBrainLambda.py
'''
the lines in the script from 11 to 22 allow you to change parameters.
The stady state are saved in 'SRuns-autapse.csv' and in 'parametersRuns-autapse.csv' are saved the labdas used in the simulations.

## Make the Structure Functions Sd

To run simulations run
'''
python makeBinnedSd.py
'''
the lines in the script from 11 to 22 allow you to change parameters.
